# DrupalX Gin Integration

The DrupalX Gin module provides some additional overrides for the [Gin contributed admin theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/gin) in order to enhance the editorial experience.

This module comes pre-installed with the [DrupalX starter distribution](https://github.com/drupalninja/drupalx-project) but is not a dependency and can be uninstalled at any time.
